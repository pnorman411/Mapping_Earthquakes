# Mapping Earthquakes

An interactive map of earthquake data was created through the use of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data.  Color-coded circle markers are used to specify the magnitude of each earthquake.  Toggle options include tectonic plates lines, earthquakes, and major earthquakes.  Street, satellite, and dark map options are also available.
